                Coding is simply of writing instructions that a computer follows. It involves creating code or programs using programming languages, which are made to do a certain task or solve a problem. coding is the main part of all softwares, aplication, and websites that we use all the time. Its a skill that helps us control computers and create tech that can do multiple tasks like simple calculations to controlling the WWW(Wolrd Wide Web). Another thing is that coding is not just limited to the tech industry because it's used in various fields such as helping people with healthcare, education, and amusement. learning to code can open up lost's of job chances and is a useful skill in the world. Its a cool process that combines logic, problem solving, and designing stuff, and so it allows for the creation of solutions and improvements in electronics. even if you're interested in developing websites, creating phone apps, or scanning data, coding is the main skill that will help you achieve these goals.</div><div class="layer1">

                You should code because it gives you access to numerous improvemments, such as increasing problem-solving skills, helping with the creation of apps, websites, and opening up lot's of career opportunities. It's a skill that helps with logical thinking and accuraccy, because coding requires a clear understanding of what you want the computer to do. Moreover, coding can be a creative skill, allowing people to bring their ideas to life and see them more in usage. With the increasing importance of technology in some places, coding skills are becoming more valuable in job options.</div><div class="layer1">

Syntax errors, are grammer mistakes in languages, where a problem from the coding rules of the programming language leads to issues that prevent the program from running correctly. These can go from from missing semicolons to the wrong use of a coding syntax syntax in a command or function. Logic errors come when the code does not follow the commands as expected, which usually leads to bad results in without any syntax issues. understanding these errors is important for programmers, because it gives them access them to debug properly and improve the accuraccy of their code. when there are logic or semantic errors, unit testing and code reviews are good tricks for figuring out the problem and their solution. to avoid errors its important if developers to have a good understanding of the programming languages they are using. as programming languages and develpoment environments improve slowly, they start to include better error detection and correction features, helping developers in writing better, more bugless code.</div> <div class="layer1">

Examples of popular IDEs include Microsoft's Visual Studio Code(I use this), which is liked for its easy to use structure and wide language support. the next one is IntelliJ IDEA, known for its advanced code analysis and suggestions for improvement. visual studio code is also liked for being open-source and free to use. On the other hand, IntelliJ IDEA offers a lot of features like version control and code completion, but you have to pay for it. Other notable IDEs are Eclipse, known for its good Java environment, and pycharm, which is good for Pyython development.

It's essential for creating interactive and responsive websites, which is also why it's good in both front-end and back-end development. HTML and CSS are also mandatory for web development because they provide the structure and style of web pages. Python has also emerged as a significant player in the web development workspace, because it's good for back-end programming. Its basic syntax and reliable libraries make it a favorite among developers for building complex web applications. Python's frameworks, like as Django and Flask, have also helped pythone be a go-to language for quick development. other languages like java, ruby, PHP, C#, and Swift also play important roles in web development. java, with its strong system, is usually favored for advanced applications. Ruby, known for its interesting syntax, helps the Ruby on Rails framework, which emphasizes convention over configuration. C# has gotten fame by working within the .NET framework. Swift, even though it is mostly for with iOS and macOS app development, has also gotten into web development becaose of its performance and safety features.</div><div class="layer3">

It is made of a lot of commands that control the machine's movements. For example, the command G00 is used for quick positioning, by oving the machine to a specified point quickly. The G01 command is used for linear interpolation, and tells the machine to move in a straight line to a specific position at a specific speed. To use G-code, you have to understand how to read and write these commands, which are often generated by software but can also be written or modified by hand for more control over the machine's actions. Learning G-code is mandatory for people who use CNC machines or 3D printers, because it is the main language that controls these devices.</div><div class="layer3">

Python, is very easy to use and easy to read. it's often the main language for artificial intelligence in robotics, making them do complex algorithms easily. java can help with flexibility in making multiple platform robotic apps. after that there are even more langauges. some of these are MATLAB which is used for mathematical modeling, and Robot Operating system (ROS) which is used as as a middleware that gives an insane amount of tools and libraries made mainly for robot programming.

Tim Berners lee's geniusness is in his talent to invent and develop HTML(Hypertext Markup Language), the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which are the main technologies of the web. with his hard work and perseverance, he could officially improve the digital world, which allowed him to create cool and easy sharing and accessing of information on the internet. Here was his early life: he was, born on June 8, 1955, in London, England, and he was the son of mathematicians who worked on the first commercial computer. Tim Berners Leew had a fascination in computers because his parents where involved in the Ferranti mark one. as a young adult Tim Berners-lee attended The Queen's College, in Oxford. in the college he received a first-class degree in physics in 1976.

It was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, making the base of internet content. HTML made it easy to structure the HTML document and linking between styles, which was very advanced at the time.when the internet had evolved a lot people needed more advanced styling and interactivity, which meant CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) had to be created. it was created in 1996 and JavaScript was created in 1995. These languages transformed basic HTML pages into dynamic, interactive experiences. In the 1990s and 2000s the dot-com bubble, was brought into internet-related investments and made an increase of internet tech. After that the coming of Web 2.0 in the early 2000s user-generated content and social media was easier to make, with softwares like AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allowing more fancier websites. The 2000s had also had the mobile increment, with the start of smartphones helping create responsive web design and to ensure content was accessible across any devices.
